      <h4>About Us</h4>
      <p>We @ iBBANi believe that lack of literacy is the root cause of many major problems in the country.We also believe that it is better to take care of our own places / areas within our reach first before solving problems. So, we selected our own village (Magodu) for the same purpose.
        Magodu is a very small village near Sira Taluk, Tumkur District in KARNATAKA, INDIA.

          <p>During my school days, I used to spend my entire summer in this village. During those days, this village had good rain & water sources due to which it used to look lush green with lots of agricultural activities. Last 15 years or so, this village didn’t see needed rain and all water sources were impacted. So, village has been becoming poor and poor year on year. The kids in this villages are not able to goto middle or highschool or schools like Navoodaya just because they can’t afford to pay those expenses.</p>
