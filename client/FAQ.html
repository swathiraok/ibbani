        <p>In order to ensure community ownership and community participation in education the  Government have evolved this system of  having for each Government school a School Development and Monitoring Committee.   Apart from others,  the main  members of this committe will be 9  parents  whose children are studying in the said school.   The SDMC has been given  necessary  powers and functions for ensuring  that the  schools  are  managed better  and most of the issues  relating to the academic aspects and developmental activities of the schools are addressed to by SDMCs.   The Head Master of the school functions as the Secretary of the SDMC.   The  present system has  been evolved  by issue of  executive orders of the Govt. of Karnataka, and action is under way  to continue the system of  SDMC and even make it  more effective for which a proposal to make these SDMCs as part of  the Panchayathi Raj Institutions, by making them sub-committees of the  respective Gram Panchayaths, is under  consideration  of the Government, in co-ordination with the Rural Development  and Panchayath Raj Department</p>
