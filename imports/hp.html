            <div class="para-wrap">
                <p>Magodu Charitable Trust (MCT) is a trust focusing on economic and social empowerment of children in Magodu village, Sira Taluk, Tumkur district, Karnataka, India. 
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p>Our mission/goal is to equip children of the Magodu village to go beyond literacy and rudimentary skills with specified knowledge, skills and values to enable them to become good human beings and productive, self-reliant, socially responsible citizens and to achieve excellence in whatever they do. Through this effort, the trust is committed to raising the level of education and literacy in Magodu village and to help disadvantaged children realise their full potential.</p> 
                <br/>
                <p>Magodu has around 150 children studying in primary and secondary school (1st to 7th grade). However, most of them won't continue to high school just because they can't afford the same. Some of them move forward but stop either at 10th grade or at 12th grade. Very few kids see graduation or engineering colleges. Those who goto higher education also struggle for their education expenses as well as to get quality education.  The same case with surrounding villages too.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>For more information about Magodu village, please visit "......"</p>
                <p>These childrens deserve to be competitive and smart.</p>
