        <h4>About Magodu</h4>
        <div class="para-wrap"><p>We @ iBBANi believe that lack of literacy is the root cause of many major problems in the country. 
            We also believe that it is better to take care of our own places / areas within our reach first 
            before solving problems. So, we selected our own village (Magodu) for the same purpose. 
            Magodu is a very small village near Sira Taluk, Tumkur District in KARNATAKA, INDIA. 
            </p>

        <h4>Current Problem</h4>
        <div class="para-wrap">
            <p>Magodu has a small Govt. school from nursery to 7th grade and around 150 kids studying in this school. 
            Govt. is providing many facilities to the school and the kids. However, there are certain things which 
            costs a lot as educational expenses for the parents due to which they are not encouraged to send their 
            kids for further studies or better education (Navodaya) etc. There are many kids who are not going to 
            school due to financial constraints. We @ iBBANi are trying to bridge this gap.</p>
